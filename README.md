# Geometric Modeling Web Implementation

## Lab 1

The first lab of the implementation is constructing curves on a plain. You can also concatenate 2 Bézier curves or duplicate any point on the curve.

## lab 2

Lab 2 let the user input a Bézier curve and then sample on the curve and output put a surface according to the choice.

## lab 3

Lab 3 part 1 is similar to lab 2, however you can choose curve type and whether a closed surfaced is drawn.

part 2 implements the subdivision method on a constructed surface or an imported one

## lab 4

lab 4 implements the 2 mesh reconstruction algorithms in 2D and combines all former labs.
